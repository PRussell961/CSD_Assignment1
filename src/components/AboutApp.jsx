        My website uses the React.JS framework to help me build my site in a
        quick and clean way. <br></br>I also implement bootstrap for quick and clean
        styling. <br></br>I followed AWS's offical guide for hosting react webpages. This guide  can be found  <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/module-one/?e=gs2020&p=build-a-react-app-intro">here</a>.

        In react I use the react-router library to help reduce load
        times by only loading new content.<br></br> So whenever a page is updated, it
        only has to load the new content, and doesnâ€™t reload the Nav Bar.

        I use AWS to host this webpage by running an Amplify instance and My React website
        is broken up into 3 components, the Navigation bar, the Image page, and
        the About me page.
